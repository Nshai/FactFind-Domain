  Notes: Vision: Client is considered to be Employed and will have an Employment record if they are Working or Semi-Retired.  We want to avoid creating an Employment record if the client has no employment. Also this question would sit at the Fact Find outside of any Employment record.
Vision List would be Working (i.e. Employed/Self-Employed), Semi-Retired, Unemployed, Retired, Student, Houseperson, Full Time Carer where only Working or Semi-Retired would create an Employment record.

Multiply uses "Full-time Study or Training" = Student, Homemaker = Houseperson, Not Employed = Unemployed
